# Introduction
During my one-month Power BI Developer internship with Foresight BI & Analytics, I worked on a comprehensive project for Forggith Pharmaceuticals, a Germany-based pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Forggith specializes in producing medical drugs distributed to consumers through a network of distributors. This project focused on creating an interactive Power BI report to analyze performance across different sectors, categories, and time periods. The goal was to provide actionable insights for various stakeholders: Sales Representatives to evaluate their performance and optimize marketing activities, Team Managers to monitor and strategize team operations, and the Executive Team to track revenue trends and assess alignment with organizational targets for informed medium- to long-term strategic planning.
