# ![Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48043b86-a06e-45e5-a7ea-daed9eeba037)

# Introduction
During my one-month Power BI Developer internship with Foresight BI & Analytics, I worked on a comprehensive project for Forggith Pharmaceuticals, a Germany-based pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Forggith specializes in producing medical drugs distributed to consumers through a network of distributors. This project focused on creating an interactive Power BI report to analyze performance across different sectors, categories, and time periods. The goal was to provide actionable insights for various stakeholders: Sales Representatives to evaluate their performance and optimize marketing activities, Team Managers to monitor and strategize team operations, and the Executive Team to track revenue trends and assess alignment with organizational targets for informed medium- to long-term strategic planning.

# Data Sourcing
The data was sourced from the Foresight BI & Analytics team since it was an internship program.

Forggith-Pharmaceuticals-Report database tables - PharmDatasets and PharmTargets The following tables were selected from the dataset to be used for the analysis

1.Channel Table
2.Employees Table
3.Location Table
4.Products Table
5.Sales Table
6.Subchannel Table

# Data Transformation
For all the tables, the first rows were changed to become Headers.

In the Sales Table, the data type for the "MonthYear" column was changed to Date. I also appended queries for the "2023-2025" sales table to the "2022" sales table and named it "Sales"

In the Targets Table, I unpivoted the year columns, then I merged the month and the year column together. I also changed the data type to Date and renamed it as "Date"

# Data Modelling
The model is a star schema. There are 5-dimension tables and 2 fact tables. The dimension tables are all joined to the fact tables with a many-to-one relationship.

# Recommendation
I recommend expanding distribution and sales beyond Europe, as this will favour sales of other classes more, especially the antimalarial drugs.
Best performing teams should be given higher bonuses as this will make other teams perform better in future years to come.
Sales Representatives seen to be performing well should be also be given bonuses, or better still have their salaries increased and should also be considered for promotions.
